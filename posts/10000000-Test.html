    <h1>Header 1</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Video provides a powerful way to help you prove your point.</b> When you click Online Video, <i>you can paste in the embed code for the video you want to add.</i> You can also type a keyword to search online for the video that best fits your document. <mark>To make your document look professionally produced, Word provides header, footer, cover page, and text box designs that complement each other.</mark> For example, you can add a matching cover page, header, and sidebar.
    </p>
    <h2>Header 2</h2>
    <p>
        Click Insert and then choose the elements you want from the different galleries. <s>Themes and styles also help keep your document coordinated.</s> When you click Design and choose a new Theme, the pictures, charts, and SmartArt graphics change to match your new theme. <sub>When you apply styles,</sub> your headings change to match the new theme. Save time in Word with new buttons that <sup>show up where you need them.</sup>
    </p>
    <h3>Header 3</h3>
    <p>
        To change the way a picture fits in your document, click it and a button for layout options appears next to it. When you work on a table, click where you want to add a row or a column, and then click the plus sign. Reading is easier, too, <code>in the new Reading view. You can collapse parts of the document</code> and focus on the text you want. If you need to stop reading before you reach the end, Word remembers where you left off - even on another device.
