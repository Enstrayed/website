# ECLS Knowledgebase
ECLS is the Single Sign On system used to login to various services available from enstrayed.com  and uses [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) for this task. ECLS stands for Enstrayed Consolidated Login System.

## Reset Password
If you need to reset your password, please contact Enstrayed to have a link sent to the email on your account. **Make sure to check your spam folder as services like Gmail and Outlook discriminate against self-hosted email services.**

## Change your Password
1. Login to ECLS
2. Click the gear icon in the top right of the page
3. Click the Change Password button and follow the process to change your password.

## Important FIDO2/Webauthn/Passkey Information
Authentik labels all FIDO2 or Passkey authenticators as Webauthn Devices. ECLS uses these as **alternatives** to your username and password, and **not** as a two factor authentication device. To properly secure your account, you must setup a TOTP device as well. 

## Update Your Personal Information
If you would like to change your username, name or email address on your ECLS account, please contact Enstrayed.

**Note that changing your username may break some applications. You will be informed ahead of time if this may happen to you.**
